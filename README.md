# Using the Observation History of a Robot to Recognize Temporal Effects in Its Environment and Adapt Its Behavior

All code used for my master's thesis. This includes many scratch files, unused results and dummy code, for which I apologise. To get an understanding of the actual code please refer to the main.py file in the src directory. The POMDP models can found in the domains dir. Specifically the 4x4MDP.POMDP, 4x4.POMDP and 6x6MDP.POMDP files show the domain variations used in the experiments.
